# Tutorial: Configuration Graph Partitions and Fusion Plans

## Overview

This tutorial covers the concepts and implementation details for configuring graph partitions and fusion plans in parallel computing, focusing on the efficient execution of the Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) algorithm. The goal is to enhance the speed of the computations by ensuring that each partition contains vertices with continuous indices and by designing a user-friendly interface in Python.

## Configuration of Graph Partitions

### Continuous Indices for Partitions

To improve computational speed, it is essential that each partition contains vertices with continuous indices. This can always be achieved by reordering the vertices in the graph. This section explains how to configure graph partitions in such a way.

**Key Concept**: Continuous indices within partitions enhance cache efficiency and reduce the complexity of the computations required during the MWPM process.

### Partitioning Strategy

1. **Identify Subgraphs**: Divide the main graph into subgraphs such that each subgraph contains a range of consecutive vertices.
2. **Reorder Vertices**: Ensure that within each subgraph, vertices are reordered to maintain continuity in their indices.
3. **User Interface**: In Python, provide an interface that allows users to describe partitions as collections of vertices rather than as regions of continuous indices.

**Example**:

```python
# Example function to partition a graph
def partition_graph(vertices, num_partitions):
    """
    Partition vertices into `num_partitions` subgraphs with continuous indices.
    
    Parameters:
    vertices (list): List of vertices in the graph.
    num_partitions (int): Number of partitions.
    
    Returns:
    list: List of subgraphs, each containing a range of continuous indices.
    """
    vertices.sort()  # Ensure vertices are ordered
    partition_size = len(vertices) // num_partitions
    partitions = [vertices[i * partition_size:(i + 1) * partition_size] for i in range(num_partitions)]
    return partitions
```

## Fusion Plans

After solving sub-problems independently, their solutions form an intermediate state. The fusion operation combines these intermediate solutions to find a global solution.

### Correctness of Fusion

**Key Concept**: The intermediate state is a valid state for the blossom algorithm. For primal variables, matchings to temporary boundary vertices are removed, and alternating trees are created for each defect vertex. Dual variables are preserved as they evolve to form a global MWPM solution.

**Example**:

```python
# Example function to fuse solutions of sub-problems
def fuse_solutions(sub_solutions, boundary_vertices):
    """
    Fuse solutions of sub-problems to form a global solution.
    
    Parameters:
    sub_solutions (list): List of sub-problem solutions.
    boundary_vertices (list): List of boundary vertices.
    
    Returns:
    global_solution: Fused global solution.
    """
    # Recover boundary vertices
    for solution in sub_solutions:
        recover_boundary_vertices(solution, boundary_vertices)
    
    # Evolve intermediate state to global solution
    global_solution = evolve_to_global_solution(sub_solutions)
    return global_solution
```

### Schedule Design: Leaf Partitions and Fusion Tree

When designing fusion plans, consider different ways to fuse solutions that balance decoding time and latency. A fusion tree defines the schedule for leaf and fusion operations.

**Example Fusion Plans**:

- **Batch Decoding**: All measurement rounds are available before decoding starts, optimizing for latency.
- **Stream Decoding**: Decoding starts as soon as a subset of measurement rounds are ready, optimizing for throughput.

**Definitions**:

- **Decoding Time (T)**: Time from when decoding starts to when it finishes.
- **Latency (L)**: Time from when all measurements are ready to when decoding finishes.
- **Measurement Rounds (N)**: Number of rounds of stabilizer measurements.
- **Leaf Partition Size (M)**: Number of measurement rounds in each leaf partition.

**Example**:

```python
# Example function for batch decoding
def batch_decode(measurement_rounds, leaf_partition_size):
    """
    Perform batch decoding of measurement rounds.
    
    Parameters:
    measurement_rounds (list): List of measurement rounds.
    leaf_partition_size (int): Size of each leaf partition.
    
    Returns:
    decoding_result: Result of the batch decoding.
    """
    leaf_partitions = partition_graph(measurement_rounds, len(measurement_rounds) // leaf_partition_size)
    decoding_result = []
    for partition in leaf_partitions:
        result = mwpm_solver(partition)
        decoding_result.append(result)
    
    global_solution = fuse_solutions(decoding_result, get_boundary_vertices(measurement_rounds))
    return global_solution
```

## Conclusion

By following this tutorial, you can effectively configure graph partitions with continuous indices and design efficient fusion plans for MWPM decoders. The Python interface hides the complexity of managing continuous indices, allowing users to focus on describing partitions as collections of vertices. This approach ensures both correctness and performance in parallel computing applications.
